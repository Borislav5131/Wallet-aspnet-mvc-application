# Wallet-aspnet-mvc-application

* This is my small ASP.NET project. It is virtual wallet in which you can buy, store and sell your assets.

* This project is my Project Defence for the ASP.Net Core course at SoftUni. The whole idea comes from my interest in cryptocurrencies and stocks recently. 

* At the moment the project is working well, the design is at a medium level. Every section of the site works and there should be no bugs, if you find bugs contact me. I plan to develop the project in the future, because I liked the idea.

* The project is ASP.Net app and an MVC template is used, the database is SQL. There is an seeding of the database.
